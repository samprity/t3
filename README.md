t3 (task tracking tree) is a way to keep track of the tasks that you are working on. Bigger tasks can be broken down into smaller tasks, which can further be broken down into smaller ones, thus creating a tree; and at each point you are working on one of the leaves of this tree. t3 can help in keeping track of your progress in this tree of tasks, hence the name.
